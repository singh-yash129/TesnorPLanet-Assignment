Data Science Internship: Assignment
Predictive Maintenance Pipeline: DPF Soot Load Prediction System
Expected effort: ~5–10 hours
Tools: Open (Python preferred)
This is a deliberately open-ended problem. There is no single correct solution. We value proactiveness, learning ability, clear thinking, reasonable assumptions, and thoughtful tradeoffs.
Thanks for your interest in this role at Tensor Planet and Good Luck! We look forward to speaking with you soon.
Deadline:
We’ll be evaluating submissions on a rolling basis and inviting candidates for interviews. Please submit whenever you’re ready, but no later than Sunday, January 18th, 2026 11:59 PM IST.
Background
Commercial vehicles generate large volumes of sensor and operational data. A key challenge in fleet operations is predicting component health early enough to take proactive action, while balancing false alarms and operational cost.
This assignment focuses on medium and heavy-duty diesel commercial vehicles (for example, refuse trucks, construction vehicles, or long-haul trucks) equipped with Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF) as part of the exhaust aftertreatment system.
In real-world operations, excessive soot accumulation in the DPF can lead to engine derate events, forced regenerations, increased fuel consumption, unplanned downtime, or component damage if not addressed proactively.
This assignment simulates a real-world predictive maintenance problem in the vehicle telemetry domain, similar to the systems we build at Tensor Planet.
You are expected to use a mix of engineering judgment, data handling, and analytical reasoning. Use of AI tools is allowed (and encouraged🙂), but please apply your critical thinking and be ready to explain all the assumptions, choices and tradeoffs.

Part 1: Data Generation & Data Engineering
Objective
Create and work with synthetic vehicle telemetry datasets that reflect real-world structure and imperfections.
Dataset Requirements
You should generate three related datasets.
1. Sensor Telemetry (time-series, per vehicle)
Example fields (you may add more):
Vehicle ID
Timestamp
Engine load (%)
Exhaust temperature (pre / post component)
Differential pressure
Exhaust flow rate
Vehicle speed
RPM
Ambient temperature

2. Maintenance Records (event-based)
Example fields:
Vehicle ID
Maintenance / regeneration timestamp
Type of action (active / passive / inspection)
Notes or status (optional)

3. Trip Characteristics (aggregated or event-based)
Example fields:
Vehicle ID
Trip start / end time
Trip distance
Trip duration
Stop-start count
Driving pattern (idle / city / highway / heavy load)

Make reasonable assumptions. You do not need to model real DPF physics accurately. Focus on consistency, structure, and manageable correlations.
Data Engineering Tasks
Build a data ingestion pipeline that loads and joins these datasets
Create feature engineering logic (below are examples, feel free to choose alternatives):
Rolling averages of exhaust temperature (indicates regeneration opportunities)
Time-weighted driving mode distribution
Cumulative distance since last regeneration
Temperature delta features (regen effectiveness indicator)
Implement data quality checks (sensor drift detection, missing value)
Design a data versioning strategy with temporal considerations

Clearly document assumptions and decisions. 
Part 2: Problem Framing & Modeling Approach
Business Challenge
You must help fleet operators decide when to proactively trigger or recommend maintenance or regeneration actions to avoid DPF soot overload, engine derate events, or unplanned downtime, while minimizing unnecessary interventions.
Tasks
Frame this business problem appropriately and describe how you would approach modeling it. Implement one or more models only if you believe it strengthens your explanation.
What target(s) would you define and why?
What tradeoffs matter most in this context?
False positives vs false negatives
Early warning vs accuracy
What modeling approaches would you consider?
Which would you try first and why?
If you tried more than one approach, compare them briefly
How would you evaluate success in a real-world deployment?

You may implement one or more models and contrast them, but share your approach with clear reasoning.

Part 3: Production & MLOps Thinking
Objective
Demonstrate how you think about productionizing such a system. 
This section is intended to assess conceptual understanding. Partial or high-level implementations are acceptable.
Tasks
Model training and experiment tracking with a tool of your choice
Hyperparameter logging
Model artifact versioning
Model serving API (for example - FastAPI/Flask):
POST /predict/soot-load
Input: Recent sensor readings (last N minutes)
Output: Soot load %, confidence interval, regeneration recommendation
POST /predict/batch
Input: Multiple vehicle readings
Output: Fleet-wide predictions
GET /model/info
Returns: Model version, training date, performance metrics
GET /health
Returns: API status, model load status
Implement monitoring:
Log prediction distributions (detect fleet-wide issues)
Monitor prediction vs actual soot load (when available)
Docker containerization with proper dependency management (lightweight acceptable)

Part 4: System Robustness & Edge Cases (Conceptual) - Bonus!
While not mandatory, answering this section would fetch you bonus points.
Objective
Demonstrate awareness of real-world failure modes.
Tasks
Error handling scenarios:
Missing sensor readings (differential pressure sensor failure)
Out-of-range values (faulty temperature sensor)
Delayed/stale data in streaming context
Network interruptions for cloud-based predictions
Testing suite:
Unit tests: Feature engineering functions, prediction logic
Integration tests: End-to-end pipeline with mock data
Edge case tests: Brand new DPF, immediately post-regeneration
CI/CD:
GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
Model validation before deployment
Documentation:
README with setup, API usage examples
Architecture diagram showing data flow
Deployment guide

Assignment - Final Deliverables:
Code (notebooks and/or scripts) with pipelines
README with instructions to run the code
Short write-up (2–3 pages max) covering:
Data generation approach
Data engineering decisions
Problem framing and modeling rationale
Production and robustness considerations
Business impact analysis of prediction errors
Recommendation with justification
Please email your submissions to hr@tensorplanet.com. Shortlisted candidates will be invited to a Technical interview and final HR round.
